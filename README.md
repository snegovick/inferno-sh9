# Sh9 - a somewhat better shell for Inferno OS

How is it different from out-of-the box shell ?

* Supports left/right, home/end keys for line editing
* Supports up/down keys for history navigation
* Has current working directory and username in its prompt instead of just ";"

Hopefully will get more tiny conveniences of modern-ish shells
